## ✨ Unique Features

### 🌓 High-Contrast Dark Mode

A global theme toggle that persists user preference and adapts all site components—from deep space backgrounds to neon-orange accents—maintaining a premium look in any light.

### ✍️ Kinetic Typography

Custom-built GSAP scroll-triggered text reveal animations that make the delivery of "Market-Ready Answers" feel dynamic and urgent.

### 🎨 Claymorphism Aesthetic

A soft, tactile design system using floating cards, deep shadows, and 3D-inspired glassmorphism to create a professional yet approachable atmosphere.

### 🏗️ Integrated Visualizers

Abstract, theme-reactive visualizers in the **Protocol** section that illustrate the 3-month strategy-to-market journey.

### 🔄 Dynamic "Manifesto"

An interactive philosophy section featuring a continuous brand marquee, kinetic manifesto text, and illuminated statistics to showcase scale and credibility.

## 🏗️ Development Process: "The 24hr Vibe"

The project was built using an "Agentic Pair Programming" approach, mirroring Innovatr's own philosophy of rapid iteration:

1.  **Foundation:** Initializing a lightning-fast Vite + React 19 environment.
2.  **Design System:** Establishing a custom Tailwind configuration for brand-specific colors (`brand-blue`, `brand-orange`) and claymorphism utilities.
3.  **Kinetic Layer:** Integrating GSAP early to ground the experience in characterful motion rather than static pixels.
4.  **Refinement:** Unifying sections (Hero & Features) to eliminate friction and focus on the core USP: _Speed_.
5.  **Dark Mode:** Implementing a robust theme-switching architecture to double the visual utility of the design.
